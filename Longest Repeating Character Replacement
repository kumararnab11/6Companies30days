//when doing mp[i]-- then we are not cross checking maxi... why?
//suppose you are given k=2... you got an array of 6 size in current ans
//therefore your maxi is 4 now
//in next step you are getting a diff ele than maxi.. so you need to trim i
//now think do you need to calculate ans for lesser maxis?
//only calculate if getting a better maxi
//bcz in order to get ans>6 maxi must be >4
